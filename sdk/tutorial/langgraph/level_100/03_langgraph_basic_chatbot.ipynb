He was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. Musk is most famously known as the CEO and lead designer of **SpaceX**, CEO and product architect of **Tesla, Inc.**, owner and CTO of **X Corp.** (formerly known as Twitter), and the founder of companies like **The Boring Company**, **Neuralink**, and **OpenAI** (he was a co-founder but is no longer directly involved).\n",

      "\n",
      "- **SpaceX**: Musk founded SpaceX in 2002 with the goal of reducing space transportation costs and enabling the colonization of Mars. SpaceX has developed rockets like Falcon 1, Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, and the Starship.\n",
      "- **Tesla, Inc.**: He became involved with Tesla in 2004, soon after its founding, and helped popularize electric vehicles, battery storage, and solar energy products.\n",
      "- **Twitter/X**: Musk acquired Twitter in 2022, later rebranding it to X, and has since implemented significant changes to the platform.\n",
      "- **The Boring Company**: Focused on tunnel construction and infrastructure projects to address urban transportation challenges.\n",
      "- **Neuralink**: Developing brain-computer interface technology.\n",
      "- **OpenAI**: Co-founded in 2015 to promote and develop friendly artificial intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Musk** is known for his ambitious vision of the future, including the colonization of Mars, transitioning the world to sustainable energy, and integrating artificial intelligence with the human brain. He is a polarizing figure, admired for his innovation but often criticized for his management style and controversial public statements.\n",
